This is a PHP fork of [RedHat/Adam Jackson's excellent open source 
edid decoder](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/edid-decode/).

It attempts to keep the changes from the original as minimal as possible
to ease integrating future improvements.

Usage instructions and examples can be found in index.php.
