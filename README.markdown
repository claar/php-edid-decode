This is a PHP fork of [RedHat/Adam Jackson's excellent open source 
edid decoder](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/edid-decode/).

It attempts to keep the changes from the original as minimal as possible
to ease integrating future improvements.

In the future, this project will (hopefully) include an access mechinism
to retrieve individual edid components (likely just an associative array).
